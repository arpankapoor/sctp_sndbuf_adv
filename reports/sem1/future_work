SDN based traffic engineering is an emerging area where sendbuffer advertisement can be used for 
performance optimization. Send buffer backlog data can be used by an SDN enabled network switch to assign
priorities to packets depending on whether the flow is network limited or application limited, to offer 
better quality of service to the flow.

The other direction is to use sendbuffer backlog for the identification of congested links by
SDN based traffic controllers. Controllers like Hedera use the assumption that flows occupying a 
bandwidth higher than a certain percentage of the host NIC's speed can be scheduled to occupy an idle link with the assumption
that the link will be filled up. Experiments show that this does not always lead to an optimal path allocation.
The flow maybe application limited and may not be capable of utilising the entire idle link bandwidth. Hence
determining if a flow is network limited or application limited can be done accurately using sendbuffer advertisement.
