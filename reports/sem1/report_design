Each chunk is formatted with a Chunk Type field, a chunk-specific Flag field, a Chunk Length field, and a Value field.
Chunk Type, which takes a value from 0 to 254,identifies the type of information contained in the Chunk Value field.
The Chunk Type values from 15 to 62,64 to 126,128 to 190 and 192 to 254 are not used presently in the SCTP implementation.
For advertising the sendbuffer occupancy,a new Chunk Type value is selected from 128 to 190. RFC lays out the actions when 
the processing endpoint does not recognize the Chunk Type(as is the case here) depending on the highest order 2 bits. 
RFC specifies that if the chunk is not recognised by the endpoint and the highest order bits are 10,the chunk will be skipped 
without sending a Unrecognized Chunk Type error chunk. This ensures that proposed addition of a new Chunk Type would not affect 
hosts running the unmodified SCTP linux implementation.

The proposed chunk format

The overhead of 8 bytes which can come up in the proposed solution is considerable as it is just 0.53% of a 1500 bye packet.
