\section{Use Case Description}
The test bed was used to create a scenario in which there are multiple
senders and multiple receivers. Multiple flows were created and the
bottleneck between the two Raspberry Pis were fully utilized. The aim
was to classify the flows according to the bandwidth requirements. The
TBF qdisc did not ensure fair sharing of bandwidth. The SFQ qdisc gives
very good performance but fails for high number of flows \cite{lartc}. We
expect our method of classification can yield better results in reducing
average flow completion time in the above case.
