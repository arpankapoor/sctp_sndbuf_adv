  Network flows need to be classified based on their bandwidth requirements to
  improve flow completion time. Bandwidth estimation based on send buffer
  occupancy, i.e.\
  the amount of backlogged data present in the sender's buffer
  has been proposed for TCP.
  This project proposes to advertise the same in SCTP and investigate
  whether this parameter is useful in classifying network flows and
  hence improve network performance.
