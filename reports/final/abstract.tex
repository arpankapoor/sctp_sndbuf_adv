  Network flows need to be prioritized dynamically in order to ensure fair
  sharing of bandwidth. Bandwidth estimation based on send buffer
  occupancy, i.e.\
  the amount of backlogged data present in the sender's buffer
  has been proposed for TCP.
  This project proposes to advertise the same in SCTP and investigate
  whether this parameter is useful in prioritizing network flows (at routers)
  and
  hence ensure fair sharing of the bandwidth among all flows.
