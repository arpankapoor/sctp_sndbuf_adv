\chapter{Conclusion}

Send buffer advertisement was implemented in Linux kernel version 4.6. This
information was used to classify packets to implement fair sharing of
bandwidth. Our implementation was based on a modified version of the Stochastic
Fairness Queuing(SFQ), qdisc in the linux kernel.

Our implementation gives a better standard deviation of bandwidth as compared to
the standard SFQ implementation with multiple flows. However, the computation
involved in our implementation degrades the average bandwidth when compared to
the standard SFQ implementation.

We expect that a hardware implementation of the classifier(like an Application
Specific Integrated Circuit) can significantly
decrease the computation time required and hence obtaining a higher average
bandwidth.
