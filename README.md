Final year BTech project @ NITC

## Extract

```Network flows need to be prioritized dynamically in order to ensure fair sharing of bandwidth.
Bandwidth estimation based on send buffer occupancy, i.e the amount of
backlogged data present in the sender's buffer has been proposed for TCP.
This project proposes to advertise the same in SCTP and investigate whether
this parameter is useful in prioritizing network flows (at routers) and hence
ensure fair sharing of the bandwidth among all the flows.```
